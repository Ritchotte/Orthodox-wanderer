                        <h2>Hi, I'm Ruth Anna</h2>
                        <p>I'm a student in British Columbia, Canada, and this is my corner of the internet for writing about one of my biggest interests: Orthodox Christian churches. The architecture, the history, the theology behind the beauty, and I find all of it genuinely fascinating, and I wanted somewhere to put all the things I've been learning.</p>

                        <p>That's my home parish in the photo: Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church. It's not the most dramatic building on this site. But it's where my faith actually took root, and I think that makes it the most important one on this list, even if it's not the most impressive architecturally.</p>

                        <p>I came to Orthodoxy through a pretty winding road. I grew up Protestant, spent years away from faith entirely, went through a period of genuinely searching across multiple traditions, and eventually found my way here through something I didn't even know existed. That word was <em>Theosis</em>.</p>

                <h2>Where I Started</h2>
                <p>I was raised Protestant, specifically in a fairly evangelical and Bible-focused tradition. Church was part of my life from the beginning. Sunday mornings, youth groups, summer camps, the whole thing. And I genuinely believed what I was taught. I wasn't going through the motions; I was really trying to live out my faith.</p>

                <p>But there was always something that felt like it was missing. I don't know exactly how to describe it without sounding vague. It's not that the faith I grew up in was wrong, exactly. It's more that it felt... incomplete. Like I kept encountering the frame of Christianity but not something that fully corresponded to what I sensed Christianity was supposed to <em>be</em>.</p>

                <p>In my late teens and early twenties, I drifted away from the faith completely. This is probably a pretty common experience. There's a point where the religion of your childhood has to become your own faith or it doesn't stick, and I hit that point and couldn't quite make the transition. So I stopped. For a few years I was just figuring out who I was without any of it.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Searching Years</h2>
                <p>I wasn't done with the questions, though. The big ones, what is this life for, what happens after, what does it mean for something to be sacred, those didn't go away just because I'd stepped back from my tradition. So I started looking around.</p>

                <p>I read a lot about Buddhism. I found the emphasis on mindfulness and the recognition of suffering genuinely valuable, and I still do. But the more I read, the more I realized that what I was actually drawn to in Buddhism was the idea of liberation, of union with something ultimate, and that idea felt like it belonged to a different tradition than the one I was exploring.</p>

                <p>I looked into Sikhism, which I found deeply admirable in its emphasis on equality, service, and the direct relationship between the individual and God. And I looked, briefly, at Islam, particularly the mystical Sufi tradition, which speaks about the longing of the soul for God in terms that are genuinely beautiful.</p>

                <p>In all of these traditions I found things that resonated. But nothing that felt like home. Nothing where I felt like I'd found the thing itself rather than a reflection of it. Nothing that answered my questions about suffering, sin, the consequences of evil and good, why the flowers bloom and then wilt, why some people live to the ripe age of 89 (my grandmother just turned 89) and some die at the age of five, why mental health is a crisis and what to do about it, why I feel guilt and shame and sorrow. None of these traditions answered those questions completely for me. Some got close. But close isn't home.</p>

                     alt="The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo — God's hand reaching toward Adam, a perfect image of the Orthodox teaching on Theosis: the human person reaching toward union with God"
                     class="theosis-image">
                <h2>The Word That Changed Everything</h2>
                <p>In early 2024, I was reading a book called <em>The Creators</em> by Daniel J. Boorstin, published in 1992. It's a non-fiction work of cultural history that traces the great works of human art, music, and literature through the ages. Boorstin moves from ancient civilizations through the Renaissance to the modern era, looking at the people who made things, painters, architects, composers, writers, and what drove them to create.</p>

                <p>And somewhere in those pages, briefly, almost in passing, appeared a word I had never seen before: <em>Theosis</em>.</p>

                <p>It was barely a sentence. Boorstin mentioned it in the context of Byzantine Christian art and the idea that human beings could participate in something divine. But something about that word caught me. I put the book down and Googled it.</p>

             
                <div class="theosis-box">
                    <h3>THEOSIS (&#952;&#941;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;)</h3>
                    <p>From the Greek meaning "deification" or "divinization." Theosis is the central teaching of Orthodox Christianity about the ultimate purpose of the human person: not merely to be forgiven for sins, and not merely to go to heaven after death, but to be <em>transformed</em>, to truly participate in the divine nature itself, as God's uncreated energies fill and transfigure the human being from within. Saint Athanasius of Alexandria stated it simply: "God became man so that man might become god." This is not a metaphor in Orthodox theology. It is the destination of the entire spiritual life.</p>
                    <p><em>The process is understood to begin now, through prayer, the sacraments, fasting, and the life of the Church. It continues after death, without limit, into eternity. The Orthodox monastic tradition, the hesychast prayer tradition, and the entire ascetic literature of the Church are structured around this one goal.</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>I stared at this for a long time. The idea that the entire purpose of the Christian life was not just to be forgiven, not just to go to heaven when you die, but to be <em>transformed</em>, to truly participate in the divine nature, as 2 Peter 1:4 actually says, was something I had never encountered in my Protestant upbringing. And this was apparently the central goal of the entire Orthodox Christian spiritual life.</p>

                <p>I typed "Orthodox Christianity" into the search bar and didn't come back up for about three months.</p>

                <p>What I found was not a modern spiritual movement or a set of abstract ideas. It was a <em>civilization</em>: theology, liturgy, art, music, ascetic practice, a complete account of human suffering and human flourishing, all woven together and unbroken for two thousand years. Every question I had been carrying around, about suffering, about guilt, about sin, about what to do with shame, about why the world is the way it is, had already been asked, wrestled with, and answered. Not just theoretically, but practically, in the lives of real people across twenty centuries. The answers were still there. I just had to go find them.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Oh, I've Never Heard of This</h2>
                <p>I knew what Catholics were. I knew what Protestants were. But Orthodox? I genuinely thought it was basically the same as Catholic. I had no idea it was a completely distinct tradition with its own theology, its own liturgy, its own saints, its own history going all the way back to the Apostles themselves.</p>

                <div class="timeline-container">
                    <img src="images/orthodox-timeline.jpeg"
                         alt="A visual timeline of Orthodox Christian history from Pentecost to the present day"
                         class="article-image-captioned">
                    <p class="image-caption">The unbroken line: 2,000 years of Orthodox Christian history.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The short version: Emperor Constantine the Great legalized Christianity in 313 AD, convened the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, and built the foundations of what became the Byzantine Christian civilization. For over 700 years the Church was unified. Then in 1054 AD, the Great Schism split East and West: the Eastern church became Orthodox Christianity, the Western church became Roman Catholicism. In the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation fractured Catholicism into thousands of denominations. Orthodox Christianity was not part of any of that. It kept going, unchanged, celebrating the same Divine Liturgy it had since the 4th century.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> &nbsp;Want the Full History?</h4>
                    <p>The <a href="history.html">History</a> page covers this in full: Constantine the Great, the Hagia Sophia, Vladimir the Great, the Great Schism, and the complete Orthodox timeline. It's worth reading if any of this is new to you.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The more I read, the more everything seemed to click into place in a way that nothing had before. The emphasis on Theosis answered the question I hadn't quite been able to articulate. The theology of icons made sense in a way that devotional images never had in other contexts. The Divine Liturgy, with its engagement of all five senses and its unchanged 1,600-year-old form, felt like something that had been preserved specifically for the moment when someone like me went looking for it.</p>

                <p>I read the lives of the saints. I started with the Desert Fathers, then worked my way through the Russian saints of the 18th and 19th centuries (see <a href="journal.html">Journal</a> for more on this). I found the <a href="journal.html">Philokalia</a>. I started attending Vespers services at a Greek Orthodox church near me just to observe. And about a year after I first typed "what is theosis" into a search engine, I walked into Saints Constantine and Helen on a Sunday morning for the Divine Liturgy for the first time.</p>

                <p>I knew before the service was over that this was it. This was what I had been looking for. I hope to become baptized with the blessing of Fr.George at my parish one day. But for now, I appreciate the beauty and community of parish until I am received. </p>

                         alt="Interior of Saints Constantine and Helen showing the iconostasis, icons, and candles">
                </div>

                <p>This parish is named after two of the most important saints in Orthodox Christianity: Constantine the Great, the Roman Emperor who legalized Christianity in 313 AD, and his mother Helena, who undertook the pilgrimage to the Holy Land in her eighties and is credited with discovering the True Cross in Jerusalem. They are both venerated as "Equal-to-the-Apostles," a title given to saints whose missionary work was on the scale of the original twelve Apostles.</p>

                <p>The building itself is modest compared to the grand cathedrals I write about on this site. But I want to say something clearly about that: <em>it doesn't matter</em>. One of the things I love most about Orthodox Christianity is that the theology doesn't change with the size of the building. Whether you're in Kizhi Pogost or this small parish in BC, the same Divine Liturgy is being celebrated. The same Christ is present on the altar. The same Holy Spirit is there in the room.</p>

                <p>There's a saying in Orthodoxy that is sometimes attributed to Dostoevsky: "Beauty will save the world." The interior of every Orthodox church, no matter how humble the outside, tries to embody that. The iconostasis, the hand painted icons, the beeswax candles, the smell of incense. Every Orthodox church is trying to give you a glimpse of heaven. And this small church in BC has given me more glimpses of it than anywhere else I've been.</p>

                <p>I hope to visit every church on this site eventually. But I'll never stop coming back to this one.</p>
