                <p>Before I get into all the grand cathedrals and UNESCO sites — this is where it started for me. Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church. It's not the biggest church. It doesn't have gold-plated domes visible from a kilometre away. But this is the place where my faith actually took root, and I don't think any church in the world will ever mean more to me than this one.</p>

                <p>There's something I always say about Orthodox churches, and this one is a perfect example of it: even when the exterior is humble, you walk inside and you are completely stopped in your tracks. The iconostasis, the icons, the candles, the smell of incense — every Orthodox church in the world, no matter how small, carries that same spirit inside. It's one of the things I love most about this tradition. Beauty is not optional. It's theologically required.</p>

                <p class="church-location"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt" title="Location"></i> British Columbia, Canada</p>
                <p>This is my home parish. Named after Saint Constantine the Great — the Roman Emperor who legalized Christianity in 313 AD — and his mother Saint Helen, who is credited with finding the True Cross in Jerusalem. Constantine and Helen are among the most important saints in Orthodox Christianity; they're sometimes called "Equal-to-the-Apostles" for their role in allowing the faith to spread openly. There's a kind of poetry in the fact that my journey to Orthodoxy began in a church named after the man who changed the legal status of Christianity forever.</p>

                <p>Canada has a surprisingly rich Orthodox presence, brought over by waves of immigration from Greece, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, Romania, and the Middle East throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Most people don't realize how many Orthodox parishes are tucked into Canadian cities. I'm just beginning to explore these.</p>

                <p>Greece is where so much of this tradition was shaped — the language of the New Testament, the early Church Fathers, the Ecumenical Councils. The landscape is covered in Orthodox churches, from tiny whitewashed chapels on cliff edges to ancient monasteries perched on dramatic hillsides.</p>

                <p>After the Baptism of Rus in 988 AD, Russia became the largest Orthodox nation in the world — and it shows. The sheer density and grandeur of Russian Orthodox architecture is unlike anything else. Saint Petersburg alone has more extraordinary churches than most countries. Here are some that I keep returning to in my research:</p>

                            <p>Built 1883–1907 on the exact spot where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated by a grenade attack in 1881. His son Alexander III insisted the memorial church be built right there, over the bloodstained cobblestones — those original cobblestones are still visible inside. The exterior is incredible, but the interior is what really gets you: over 7,000 square metres of mosaics covering every wall, pillar, and vaulted surface. Under Soviet rule it served as a potato warehouse. It reopened as a museum in 1997 and has never been used for actual services. Still one of the most visited churches in Russia.</p>

The golden dome is visible from all over the city. During the Soviet era it was converted into a museum of atheism — a somewhat ironic use for such an overwhelming statement of religious architecture.</p>

                            <p>Designed by Andrei Voronikhin (1801–1811) and directly inspired by Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome — a conscious statement that Orthodox Russia was the equal of Catholic Europe. The defining feature is its massive curved colonnade of 96 Corinthian columns sweeping along Nevsky Prospect. Inside, it houses the revered Kazan Icon of the Mother of God, one of the most important icons in Russian Orthodoxy. The cathedral was actually turned into a museum of the history of religion and atheism during the Soviet era — they literally put anti-religious exhibits inside one of Russia's holiest churches.</p>

Peter the Great personally commissioned the transfer of his relics to this monastery in 1724, travelling part of the way in the boat that carried the relics himself.</p>

The blue and white facade with golden domes is absolutely beautiful, and the proportions are perfect in a way that photographs don't quite capture. Fun (somewhat sad) fact: Rastrelli's original design included an enormous 140-metre bell tower that would have been the tallest in Russia. It was never built because Elizabeth ran out of money. You can still see where it was supposed to go.</p>

The white exterior with intricate pink Gothic tracery and pinnacles was designed by the architect Yury Felten. It was completely deconsecrated under Soviet rule and converted into a branch of the Naval Museum, which at least probably preserved it from further damage.</p>

The dome is 26 metres in diameter and rises 52 metres above the ground — it served as a navigational landmark for ships entering Saint Petersburg for decades. The interior walls were originally lined with bronze plaques listing the names of every Russian naval officer who died in service. The Soviets stripped everything out and turned it into a cinema, then a concert hall. A major restoration completed in 2013 returned it to a working church.</p>

Smolensk itself has one of the saddest and most dramatic histories of any Russian city — it was devastated by Napoleon in 1812 and almost completely destroyed again during World War II.

                            <p>This cathedral has an interesting history because it's never been just a religious building — it's always been political. Built between 1894 and 1900 during the period of Russian Imperial rule over Estonia, it was positioned on Toompea Hill directly opposite the Estonian parliament building. After Estonian independence, there were serious discussions about demolishing it. It survived, and it remains the largest Orthodox church in Estonia. Whether you see it as a beautiful building or a symbol of foreign domination depends entirely on your perspective — and that ambiguity is part of what makes it fascinating.</p>

                            <h3>Debre Birhan Selassie</h3>
                            <p class="church-location"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt" title="Location"></i> Gondar, Ethiopia</p>
                            <p>Look up the next time you're in this church. The entire ceiling is covered with 135 painted cherub faces staring down at you — row after row of them, large eyes and round cheeks, all watching. It's one of the most striking interior decorations in any church anywhere in the world. The building itself dates to the late 17th century and is one of the best-preserved examples of Ethiopian ecclesiastical architecture, which is completely distinct from Byzantine or Russian traditions — it developed in isolation and follows its own logic entirely.</p>

The Greek Orthodox presence in southern Africa dates back over a century, and this cathedral is one of the most prominent Orthodox buildings on the continent. It's a reminder that Orthodoxy isn't just a religion of Eastern Europe and the Middle East — it's genuinely a world religion with communities on every inhabited continent.</p>

                <p>This one always surprises people. Orthodox Christianity in Japan? It's real, and it has been for over 150 years — and it produced one of the most unexpected and beautiful churches I've ever come across.</p>

                            <p class="church-location"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt" title="Location"></i> Tokyo, Japan</p>
                            <p>Standing in Ochanomizu, Tokyo, is a Byzantine domed cathedral that looks completely incongruous with everything around it — in the best possible way. Built between 1884 and 1891, it was designed by the Russian architect Mikhail Shchurупов and completed under the supervision of Josiah Conder, the British architect who brought Western-style architecture to Meiji-era Japan. It's named after Saint Nicholas of Japan — the Russian Orthodox missionary Nikolai Kasatkin who spent over 50 years in Japan converting thousands of Japanese people to Orthodoxy. He's now venerated as a saint by both the Russian and Japanese Orthodox churches. The building was badly damaged in the 1923 Great Kant&#333; Earthquake and rebuilt. It's still an active parish today.</p>
