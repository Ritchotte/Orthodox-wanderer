                <h2>Welcome to Orthodox Wanderer</h2>
                <p>I grew up Protestant, spent years searching, and eventually found something I never expected: a 2,000 year old faith that had not changed. Orthodox Christianity stopped me in my tracks, not just because of the theology, but because of the <em>beauty</em>. The incense, the icons, the chanting, the overwhelming sense that something sacred had been happening in that same liturgical form for centuries.</p>

                <p>This site is my attempt to share that. Whether you're Orthodox and want to see churches beyond your local parish, a traveler who loves stunning architecture, or just someone curious, you are welcome here. These buildings aren't just beautiful. They're alive with history, theology, and a tradition that goes all the way back to the Apostles.</p>

                <p>The Orthodox world is bigger than most people in North America realize. I'm slowly documenting as much of it as I can, starting with the churches I've researched, dreamed about, and in some cases visited.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Beauty will save the world."</p>
                    <cite>— Fyodor Dostoevsky, <em>The Idiot</em></cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In Orthodoxy, this isn't just a nice quote. Beauty is genuinely considered a path to God. The church building itself is a form of theology. Every mosaic, every carved iconostasis, every golden dome is intentional. When you walk into an Orthodox church, you're not just entering a building. You're entering a different kind of space.</p>

            <p class="pull-quote">
                "We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth. For on earth there is no such splendour or beauty, and we are at a loss how to describe it."

                <h2>Why Orthodox Churches?</h2>
                <p>There's a common saying in Orthodoxy that the church building should give you a glimpse of heaven. This idea goes all the way back to when Prince Vladimir of Kiev sent emissaries out across the known world in search of the true faith. When they walked into the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and witnessed the Divine Liturgy, they came back and said they couldn't tell whether they were in heaven or still on earth.</p>

                <p>That's the goal. Every detail, the gold leaf on the icons, the smell of frankincense, the chanting, is designed to pull you out of the ordinary world and into something transcendent. Orthodox Christians call this <em>theosis</em>: the process of becoming united with God. And beauty is considered one of the most direct paths to experiencing that.</p>

                <p>I think that's why I keep coming back to these churches even as someone who grew up in a tradition that was pretty suspicious of all this aesthetic stuff. There's something happening in these spaces that words don't really cover. The architecture isn't decoration. It's doctrine in stone, gold, and glass.</p>
